	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p><img class="photo" src="headshot.jpg" alt="Steven Tu" />My name is Hung-Cheng Steven Tu (涂宏成). I was most recently a junior manager at Chunghwa Investment, the investment subsidiary of Chunghwa Telecom. Previously I worked for Enspire Capital, an early-stage venture capital firm from Singapore, as an investment analyst.</p>
	<p>With a hybrid academic background, I had greatly benefited from my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Master’s degree in Economics in my work as a venture capitalist. When I evaluate a potential investment, knowledge in engineering enables better understanding of the industry trend and the technology involved, while training in economics helps me analyze the macro economy, the market condition and the business model before forming the investment thesis.</p>
	<p>In carrying out the due diligence work, I put great emphasis on product usability and user experience to verify the value proposition of the product/company. Customer feedback is also highly valuable for me to see if customer needs are indeed satisfied. Working with entrepreneurs to build great products and create values for customers is the most exciting part in my line of work.</p>
	<p>I like to build things, too. As an enthusiastic baseball fan, I have collaborated with friends and associates to publish a baseball magazine on an annual basis since 2007, in which we preview the upcoming baseball season for our readers with analyses and feature stories. Another example was that I volunteered to build and maintain the company website for my then employer in my spare time, and since then I have continued enhancing my programming skills in Javascript, jQuery and Python using online resources.</p>
	<p>English fluency is one of my strong suits. I scored 110 out of a possible 120 in the TOEFL Internet-based Test in 2007, and scored a perfect 990 in the TOEIC exam in 2012. Accustomed to an English-intensive work environment, I handle verbal and written communication well.</p>
	<p>In my view, venture capital is more about providing services to entrepreneurs than making financial investments. In the end, I find myself most interested in building a great product and a successful business. I am confident that with my strengths, enthusiasm and experiences, I can contribute in the areas of product management, business development and financial planning.</p>
